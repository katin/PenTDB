Pentesting Tracker Databse with HTML Interface

### Current status notes:
The 10-Jun-2019 version requires both php-xml and php-curl, which works fine on PHP7.2 on Debian 9, but has a conflict on the PWK Kali 2018.3 version. Don't try to install both; you may well bork your Kali VM.

Next up: I'll make mods to remove the php-xml requirement, so it'll run on a default PWK Kali VM.
