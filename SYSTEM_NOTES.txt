SYSTEM_NOTES.txt

BINARY STATUS
-------------
An empty status field shows a gray indicator button - no action has been taken yet.
An "IN-PROGRESS" status shows light orange, that the test is running.

A POS status shows as a green indicator: test completed with a useful data/path forward.
A NEG status shows as a red indicator: test showed no results / no clues / no path.

Either way, the test is completed with either a POS or NEG status, which marks the test title bar with a GREEN background (completed).


DEPTH STATUS
------------






HOST type records start with just the session_id and ip_address, and can be used to hold notes, creds found, and other such host information.
