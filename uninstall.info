TO UNINSTALL PENTDB:
Follow these steps:

1) Disable and remove apache site file.
  # a2dissite pentdb.com
  # sudo rm /etc/apache2/sites-available/pentdb.conf

2) Remove the "Listen 127.0.0.1:411" line from /etc/apache2/ports.conf

3) Remove the "127.0.0.1   pentdb.kali.local" line from /etc/hosts

4) DROP database(s) from mysql (named pentdb_nnnn).
   Perhaps you'd like to export your data first?
   If the db contains results and tests for a pentesting client, be sure to encrypt or destroy the data.

5) Delete database users (format is unnnn).
   mysql> DELETE from db WHERE Db='pentdb_nnnn';
   mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE User='unnnn';

6) remove the PenTDB directory.
   # rm -rf /path/to/PenTDB

If you ran the installer multiple times, there will be multiple pentdb databases and users in mysql.
